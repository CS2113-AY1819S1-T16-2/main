== Overview

This project portfolio documents my contributions to the development of the CS2113 project, as part of my team T16-2.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to store, login, logout, showmine and sort* via the login, logout, showmine
 and sort command
** What it does: Allow users to save the events created, login according to designation and sorting the event based
on the parameters they input.
** Justification: These features allow users to use application's function according to their designation. Users who login
  with their personal email are able to list event they are associated with. The sort function sort the current
event list view  based on their requirement. For example, if the user need to see which event is coming soon, they are able to so by
using the sort date command.
** Highlights:


* *Minor enhancement*:
** Created the event class along with its relevant components
** Updated the mainapp to load saved xml events or a sample list of events when the app starts
