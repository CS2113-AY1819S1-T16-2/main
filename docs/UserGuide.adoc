== Introduction

ProManage is a *professional desktop application* for companies that specialises in executing projects that undergoes a
long and tedious planning phase, prior to their event. This is particularly useful for companies that have a distinct structure
and chain of command. For each project, there is a project team, which is usually led by a *Manager*. The planning
committee consists of various branches: *Admin, Logistics, Programmes, Finance, Publicity, Marketing and Safety*.

Our application aims to ease the mode of task, event allocation and management by providing an all-in-one platform for
the project team. It saves companies' time and money. Our customers will feel at ease communicating with one another in
their project team setting. There is no better way to work than a CLI application that facilitates workflow than ProManage!
More importantly, ProManage is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still
having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). ProManage can help you manage project scheduling effectively.
